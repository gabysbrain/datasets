The Visible Human Project
=========================

### Overview

The NLM Visible Human Project has created publicly-available complete,
anatomically detailed, three-dimensional representations of a human male
body and a human female body. Specifically, the VHP provides a
public-domain library of cross-sectional cryosection, CT, and MRI images
obtained from one male cadaver and one female cadaver. The Visible Man
data set was publicly released in 1994 and the Visible Woman in 1995.

The data sets were designed to serve as (1) a reference for the study of
human anatomy, (2) public-domain data for testing medical imaging
algorithms, and (3) a test bed and model for the construction of
network-accessible image libraries. The VHP data sets have been applied
to a wide range of educational, diagnostic, treatment planning, virtual
reality, artistic, mathematical, and industrial uses. About 4,000
licensees from 66 countries were authorized to access the datasets. As
of 2019, a license is no longer required to access the VHP datasets.

NLM thanks the man and the woman who each willed their body to science,
thereby enabling this project.

The VHP data sets were created under contract to NLM by the University
of Colorado Health Sciences Center (primary) and the National Center for
Atmospheric Research.

**Origin, Goals,** **and Usage**

The Visible Human Project^®^ is an outgrowth of the NLM 1986 Long-Range
Plan, which foresaw a future in which NLM "bibliographic and factual
database services would be complemented by libraries of digital images,
distributed over high speed computer networks and by high capacity
physical media."

The 1998 NLM Board of Regents report affirmed "the long-term goal of the
Visible Human Project, which is to produce a system of knowledge
structures that will transparently link visual knowledge forms to
symbolic knowledge formats such as the names of body parts." The report
continued: "NLM support of research on image data sets and tools that
offer the potential of generating new biomedical knowledge, and the
means to develop and use such knowledge, in collaboration with U.S. and
international research partners, is a valuable contribution to
international health efforts. Such research should emphasize the tools,
technologies, and technical standards for creating, managing, and
accessing the large-scale image data sets like those being developed by
the Visible Human Project."

According to that report, by 1998 the Visible Human data sets had "been
licensed for use worldwide by some 1000 research, academic, and
industrial groups in 28 countries. The images are being used for
teaching, modeling radiation absorption and therapy, equipment design,
surgical simulation, and simulation of diagnostic procedures, ...."

**Visible Human Male**

The Visible Human Male data set consists of MRI, CT, and anatomical
images. Axial MRI images of the head and neck, and longitudinal sections
of the rest of the body were obtained at 4mm intervals. The MRI images
are 256 by 256 pixel resolution with each pixel made up of 12 bits of
gray tone. The CT data consist of axial CT scans of the entire body
taken at 1mm intervals at a pixel resolution of 512 by 512 with each
pixel made up of 12 bits of gray tone. The approximately 7.5 megabyte
axial anatomical images are 2048 pixels by 1216 pixels, with each pixel
being .33mm in size, and defined by 24 bits of color. The anatomical
cross-sections are at 1mm intervals to coincide with the CT images.
There are 1,871 cross-sections for both CT and anatomical images. The
complete male data set is approximately 15 gigabytes.

Higher resolution axial anatomical images of the male data set were made
available in August 2000. Seventy-millimeter still photographs taken
during the cryosectioning procedure were digitized at a pixel resolution
of 4096 pixels by 2700 pixels. These images, each approximately 32
megabytes in size, are available for all 1,871 male color cryosections.

**Visible Human Female**

The Visible Human Female data set has the same characteristics as the
Visible Human Male. However, the axial anatomical images were obtained
at 0.33 mm intervals. Spacing in the "Z" dimension was reduced to 0.33mm
in order to match the 0.33mm pixel sizing in the "X-Y" plane. As a
result, developers interested in three-dimensional reconstructions are
able to work with cubic voxels. There are 5,189 anatomical images in the
Visible Human Female data set. The data set size is approximately 40
gigabytes.
